  <h2>Planet Earth<h2>
    
  <p><bold>Earth.</bold><br> Earth, the place where we live is unlike any planet and <em>Unique in multiple ways.</em> Earth is the 3rd planet away from the sun with a diameter of over 11,750 KM. Our planet Earth hosts living spaces to various types of creatures and and artificial creations alike. <br>
    Earth is also very well known to be the only planet confirmed to host life. However, this is a contreversial statement. While Earth provides life, land and water to every being on Earth, most of us don't pay back and fulfill our duty that we owe to our Earth such as keeping our Planet clean, safe and pristine.<br>
    Despite theseproblems, I feel that if we all make sure to work as a team, not as a city, not as a country but an entire world, we can easily conquer various difficulties approaching towards Earth's population whether animals or humans at a lightning fast speed. In his webpage, I have listed some problems which we are already suffering and problems that are coming rapidly towards Earth. However, I have also attached ways on how we can stop these difficulties from occuring in the first place and how to make the present problems disappear.<br>
    I request you, the reader to  ead on even more to increase your knowledge on our beloved Earth and try to spread the word on how to stop these issues from arising in the first place. </p>
