  <h2>Our World</h2>
    
  <p><strong>Earth.<br> Earth, the place where we live is unlike any planet and <em>unique in multiple ways.</em> Earth is the 3rd planet away from the sun with a diameter of over <em>11,750 Km!</em> Our planet Earth hosts living spaces to <em>various types of creatures and artificial creations alike.</em> <br><br>
    Earth is also very well known to be the <em>only planet confirmed to host life.</em> However, this is a contreversial statement. While Earth provides <em>life, land and water to every being on Earth</em>, most of us don't pay back and fulfill our duty that we owe to our Earth such as <em>keeping our Planet clean, safe and pristine.</em><br><br>
    Despite these problems, I feel that <em>if we all make sure to work as a team, not as a city, not as a country but an entire world,</em> we can easily conquer various difficulties approaching towards Earth's population whether animals or humans at a <em>lightning fast speed.</em> In his webpage, I have listed some problems which we are already suffering and problems that are coming <em>rapidly</em> towards Earth. However, I have also attached ways on how we can <em>stop these difficulties from occuring in the first place</em> and how to make the present problems disappear.<br><br>
    I request you, the reader to read on <em>even more</em> to increase your knowledge on our beloved Earth and try to spread the word on how to <em>stop these issues from arising.</em></strong> </p><br><br><br>

  <h2>Our World: Deteriorating</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Climate change.<br> I am sure that you have heard of this phrase <em>numerous times.</em> Its poularity is growing day by day and <em>little to none action</em> is being taken place to prevent the harm of <em>our planet.</em> I would like for you to imagine this, people <em>stuck in their homes</em> because of the scorching heat, pollution laying <em>astray on streets,</em> humans and animals alike <em>not being able to get the nourishment they require</em> because of the shortages in clean water. I know that these images are <em>not</em> pretty sights.<br>
    This might be the fate and state of future generations' daily lives. As a matter of fact, these are only a few of the difficulties approaching Earth. In the bottom bullet list, I have noted down more problems which are interlinked with climate change.</strong><p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Droughts</li>
  <li>Storms</li>
  <li>Heat Waves</li>
  <li>Rising Sea Levels</li>
  <li>Warming Oceans</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Aside from the list above, <em>pollution</em> is a whole another case! Not only does Earth get <em>attacked</em> by Climate change, <em>pollution also exists</em>, and we need to halt this <em>damage</em> which is done to Earth. It surprised me a lot when I realised that <em>the same people</em> that depend on Earth to live are also <em>killing Earth</em>. This <em>does not</em> benefit anyone!<br> 
    The three main types of pollution are listed underneath:</strong></p>
    
  <ol>
    <li>Land Pollution- Trash <strong>littering</strong> the land which leads to a <strong>loss</strong> of fertile land for agriculture.</li>
    <li>Water Pollution- <strong>Trash</strong> in water which sometimes results into sea animals <strong>eating</strong> it and falling <strong>sick or dying.</strong></li>
    <li>Air Pollution- <strong>Harmful</strong> gases mixing with the clean gases in air which can cause <strong>respiratory damages.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Finally, a website named Climate.gov stated that tempratures had been <em>rising</em> about 0.08 celsius per decade since 1880. However, since 1981, the temprature had been rising <em>more than double</em> that amount per decade: <em>0.18 celsius!</em><br> In addition, this website also stated that 2021 had been the <em>6th warmest year on record!</em><br>
    If this trend <em>keeps continuing</em>, it will be barely any time before we are <em>stuck</em> at our homes all year with <em>barely</em> any snow around the world. This is <em>no joke</em>.<br>
    Even with all these downsides, <em>hope</em> is being able to see that <em>there is light</em> despite all of the darkness and there is <em>definitely</em> some hope remaining.<br> 
    So read on to the <em>final</em> section of this webpage to figure out how to combat these <em>adversities</em>.</strong></p><br><br><br>
