  <h2>Our World</h2>
    
  <p class="world"><strong>Earth.<br> Earth, the place where we live is unlike any planet and <em>unique in multiple ways.</em> Earth is the 3rd planet away from the sun with a diameter of over <em>11,750 Km!</em> Our planet Earth hosts living spaces to <em>various types of creatures and artificial creations alike.</em> <br><br>
    Earth is also very well known to be the <em>only planet confirmed to host life.</em> However, this is a contreversial statement. While Earth provides <em>life, land and water to every being on Earth</em>, most of us don't pay back and fulfill our duty that we owe to our Earth such as <em>keeping our Planet clean, safe and pristine.</em><br><br>
    Despite these problems, I feel that <em>if we all make sure to work as a team, not as a city, not as a country but an entire world,</em> we can easily conquer various difficulties approaching towards Earth's population whether animals or humans at a <em>lightning fast speed.</em> In his webpage, I have listed some problems which we are already suffering and problems that are coming <em>rapidly</em> towards Earth. However, I have also attached ways on how we can <em>stop these difficulties from occuring in the first place</em> and how to make the present problems disappear.<br><br>
    I request you, the reader to read on <em>even more</em> to increase your knowledge on our beloved Earth and try to spread the word on how to <em>stop these issues from arising.</em></strong> </p><br><br><br>

  <h2>Our World: Deteriorating</h2>
  
  <p class="deteriorating"><strong>Climate change.<br> I am sure that you have heard of this phrase <em>numerous times.</em> Its poularity is growing day by day and <em>little to none action</em> is being taken place to prevent the harm of <em>our planet.</em> I would like for you to imagine this, people <em>stuck in their homes</em> because of the scorching heat, pollution laying <em>astray on streets,</em> humans and animals alike <em>not being able to get the nourishment they require</em> because of the shortages in clean water. I know that these images are <em>not</em> pretty sights.<br>
    This might be the fate and state of future generations' daily lives. As a matter of fact, these are only a few of the difficulties approaching Earth. In the bottom bullet list, I have noted down more problems which are interlinked with climate change.</strong></p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Droughts</li>
  <li>Storms</li>
  <li>Heat Waves</li>
  <li>Rising Sea Levels</li>
  <li>Warming Oceans</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="deteriorating"><strong>Aside from the list above, <em>pollution</em> is a whole another case! Not only does Earth get <em>attacked</em> by Climate change, <em>pollution also exists</em>, and we need to halt this <em>damage</em> which is done to Earth. It surprised me a lot when I realised that <em>the same people</em> that depend on Earth to live are also <em>killing Earth</em>. This <em>does not</em> benefit anyone!<br> 
    The three main types of pollution are listed underneath:</strong></p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Land Pollution- Trash <strong>littering</strong> the land which leads to a <strong>loss</strong> of fertile land for agriculture.</li>
    <li>Water Pollution- <strong>Trash</strong> in water which sometimes results into sea animals <strong>eating</strong> it and falling <strong>sick or dying.</strong></li>
    <li>Air Pollution- <strong>Harmful</strong> gases mixing with the clean gases in air which can cause <strong>respiratory damages.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="deteriorating"><strong>Finally, a website named Climate.gov stated that tempratures had been <em>rising</em> about 0.08 celsius per decade since 1880. However, since 1981, the temprature had been rising <em>more than double</em> that amount per decade: <em>0.18 celsius!</em><br> In addition, this website also stated that 2021 had been the <em>6th warmest year on record!</em><br>
    If this trend <em>keeps continuing</em>, it will be barely any time before we are <em>stuck</em> at our homes all year with <em>barely</em> any snow around the world. This is <em>no joke</em>.<br>
    Even with all these downsides, <em>hope</em> is being able to see that <em>there is light</em> despite all of the darkness and there is <em>definitely</em> some hope remaining.<br> 
    So read on to the <em>final</em> section of this webpage to figure out how to combat these <em>adversities</em>.</strong></p><br><br><br>

     <h2>Our World: Arising<h2>
          
          <h4><strong>An Environmentalist.<br>A type of person we <em>all</em> need to be more of. An environmentalist is a person who is interested in or studies the environment and who tries to <em>protect</em> it from being damaged by human activities. I understand that all of us are tired of hearing the <em>same</em> thing again and again on how to prevent and <em>stop</em> climate change but this needs to be reinforced in our minds <em>multiple</em> times for a change to actually occur.<br>
               In the previous section of this webpage, I wrote about all the <em>difficulties</em> and problems that we are facing or ultimately going to face in coming times. <em>However</em>, in this section, I am going to write on how to <em>combat</em> these issues. This is our planet, we depend on Earth to live, so it is <em>our duty</em> to take care and <em>nurture</em> nature.<br>
               The United States of America pledged to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emmisions by <em>50 percent</em> by 2030. Narendra Modi from India promised that India would increase its renewable fuel capacity to <em>500 gigawatts</em> from 156 gigawatts by 2030. However, these pledges might not be able to live up to their statements if you take the current rate of <em>climate change</em> into consideration.<br>
               Luckily, there is something called the <em>Sustainable Developement Goals.</em> These goals provide an insight on how to save our planet from climate change and <em>global warming.</em> The United Natons had created these goals, intending for <em>every</em> country on Earth to fulfill these goals <em>before</em> 2030. An effort must be taken to accomplish these goals or it would be <em>too late</em> to save Earth. Some of the Sustainable Development Goals are provided in the list below.</strong></h4>
          
          <ol>
               <li><strong>Clean</strong> Water and <strong>Sanitation</strong></li>
               <li><strong>Affordable</strong> and <strong>Clean</strong> Energy</li>
               <li><strong>Sustainable</strong> Cities and Communities</li>
               <li><strong>Responsible</strong> Consumption and Production</li>
               <li><strong>Climate</strong> Action</li>
          </ol>
          
         <h4><strong>And there are <em>12</em> more too! If we tried our <em>best</em> to implement these goals in our daily lives, <em>so</em> much would change!<br>
               Very recently an event had taken place in Egypt from 6-20 November 2022 which was named <em>COP27.</em> This event was held for a <em>specific</em> purpose: Climate change. Leaders of a <em>numerous</em> amount of countries gathered in Egypt to discuss about climate change, its impacts and how to get <em>rid</em> of it. I am not going to dwell on this topic for long but I will summarise it: <em>Every</em> leader in that summit promised to <em>help</em> the environment someway or another and they discussed the <em>impacts</em> of clmate change.<br>
               The leaders who attended also stated that they would <em>spread</em> the word to the citizens of their respective country. Many meetings have been held before this one which were <em>quite</em> similar to COP27. Furthermore, In the previous section I had mentioned the <em>different</em> types of pollution and in the list below, I have written the <em>3 main steps</em> on how to combat pollution. I am sure that you have already heard of <em>these</em> steps and they are also represented in the GIF <em>above.</em></strong></h4>
              
          <ol>
               <li><strong>Reuse</strong></li>
               <li><strong>Reduce</strong></li>
               <li><strong>Recycle</strong></li>
          </ol>

          
          <h4>Instead of becoming more <em>dependent</em>, we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and electricity <em>right away.</em> Opt for <em>eco-friendly</em> options like solar energy and wind power.<br>
               Walk and cycle for <em>short</em> distances instead of driving vehicles that produce <em>harmful</em> gases. Roads are <em>clogged</em> with vehicles that use diesel. Even <em>one</em> car gone can make a difference. For longer distances, use public transport or carpool <em>as much as possible.</em><br>
               Eat <em>more</em> Vegetables. If you eat more vegetarian foods like legumes, beans, nuts, fruits and vegetables; it can <em>significantly</em> improve your enviromental impact, as animals require <em>lots</em> of food, land and water to be grown to end in <em>your</em> mouths.<br>
               Throw away less food. The <em>more</em> food you waste, the more <em>resources and effort</em> is wasted that was put into the <em>growing</em> of that particular food. And when this wasted food ends up in a <em>landfill</em>, it emitts <em>methane</em> which is a very <em>powerful</em> Greenhouse Gas.<br>
               Consider the amount of <em>travelling</em> you do. Aeroplanes produce a <em>large</em> amount of Greenhouse gases when flying which increases <em>your</em> contribution towards climate change. Opt towards, if you can, meeting <em>virtually</em> unless for a family meet up or an <em>emergency</em>.<br>
               If you can't <em>reuse</em> something, <em>refuse</em> it.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Finally, I would like to end by hoping that you have <em>understood</em> the message I am trying to convey in this webpage on why climate change is <em>disastrous</em> for Earth.<br>
               Although there are many problems, there is <em>always</em> a fix, and the fix are the solutions which I have provided in the section <em>above</em>. I encourage <em>you</em> to share this <em>knowlegable</em> information with anyone you think who needs it and if you do, think of yourself as an <em>Eco-Warrior!</em></h4>
