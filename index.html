  <h2>Our World</h2>
    
  <p><strong>Earth.<br> Earth, the place where we live is unlike any planet and <em>unique in multiple ways.</em> Earth is the 3rd planet away from the sun with a diameter of over <em>11,750 Km!</em> Our planet Earth hosts living spaces to <em>various types of creatures and artificial creations alike.</em> <br><br>
    Earth is also very well known to be the <em>only planet confirmed to host life.</em> However, this is a contreversial statement. While Earth provides <em>life, land and water to every being on Earth</em>, most of us don't pay back and fulfill our duty that we owe to our Earth such as <em>keeping our Planet clean, safe and pristine.</em><br><br>
    Despite these problems, I feel that <em>if we all make sure to work as a team, not as a city, not as a country but an entire world,</em> we can easily conquer various difficulties approaching towards Earth's population whether animals or humans at a <em>lightning fast speed.</em> In his webpage, I have listed some problems which we are already suffering and problems that are coming <em>rapidly</em> towards Earth. However, I have also attached ways on how we can <em>stop these difficulties from occuring in the first place</em> and how to make the present problems disappear.<br><br>
    I request you, the reader to read on <em>even more</em> to increase your knowledge on our beloved Earth and try to spread the word on how to <em>stop these issues from arising.</em></strong> </p><br><br><br>

  <h2>Our World: Deteriorating</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Climate change.<br> I am sure that you have heard of this phrase <em>numerous times.</em> Its poularity is growing day by day and <em>little to none action</em> is being taken place to prevent the harm of <em>our planet.</em> I would like for you to imagine this, people <em>stuck in their homes</em> because of the scorching heat, pollution laying <em>astray on streets,</em> humans and animals alike <em>not being able to get the nourishment they require</em> because of the shortages in clean water. I know that these images are <em>not</em> pretty sights.<br>
    This might be the fate and state of future generations' daily lives. As a matter of fact, these are only a few of the difficulties approaching Earth. In the bottom bullet list, I have noted down more problems which are interlinked with climate change.</strong><p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Droughts</li>
  <li>Storms</li>
  <li>Heat Waves</li>
  <li>Rising Sea Levels</li>
  <li>Warming Oceans</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Aside from the list above, <em>pollution</em> is a whole another case! Not only does Earth get <em>attacked</em> by Climate change, <em>pollution also exists</em>, and we need to halt this <em>damage</em> which is done to Earth. It surprised me a lot when I realised that <em>the same people</em> that depend on Earth to live are also <em>killing Earth</em>. This <em>does not</em> benefit anyone!<br> 
    The three main types of pollution are listed underneath:</strong></p>
    
  <ol>
    <li>Land Pollution- Trash <strong>littering</strong> the land which leads to a <strong>loss</strong> of fertile land for agriculture.</li>
    <li>Water Pollution- <strong>Trash</strong> in water which sometimes results into sea animals <strong>eating</strong> it and falling <strong>sick or dying.</strong></li>
    <li>Air Pollution- <strong>Harmful</strong> gases mixing with the clean gases in air which can cause <strong>respiratory damages.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Finally, a website named Climate.gov stated that tempratures had been <em>rising</em> about 0.08 celsius per decade since 1880. However, since 1981, the temprature had been rising <em>more than double</em> that amount per decade: <em>0.18 celsius!</em><br> In addition, this website also stated that 2021 had been the <em>6th warmest year on record!</em><br>
    If this trend <em>keeps continuing</em>, it will be barely any time before we are <em>stuck</em> at our homes all year with <em>barely</em> any snow around the world. This is <em>no joke</em>.<br>
    Even with all these downsides, <em>hope</em> is being able to see that <em>there is light</em> despite all of the darkness and there is <em>definitely</em> some hope remaining.<br> 
    So read on to the <em>final</em> section of this webpage to figure out how to combat these <em>adversities</em>.</strong></p><br><br><br>

     <h2>Our World: Arising<h2>
          
          <p><strong>An Environmentalist.<br>A type of person we all need to be more of. An environmentalist is a person who is interested in or studies the environment and who tries to protect it from being damaged by human activities. I understand that all of us are tired of hearing thhe same thing again and again on how to prevent and stop climate change but this needs to be reinforced in our minds multiple times for a change to actually occur.<br>
                In the previous section of this webpage, I wrote about all the difficulties and problems that we are facing or ultimately going to face in coming times. However, in this section, I am going to write on ow to combat these issues. This is our planet, we depend on Earth to live, so it is our duty to take care and nurture nature.<br>
               The United States of America pledged to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emmisions by 2030. Narendra Modi from India promised that India would increase its renewable fuel capacity to 500 gigawatts from 156 gigawatts by 2030. However, these pledges might not be able to live up to these statements if you take the current rate of climate change into consideration.<br>
               Luckily, there is something called the Sustainable Developement Goals. These goals provide an insight on how to save our planet from climate change and global warming. The United Natons had created these goals, intending for every country on Earth to fulfill these goals before 2030. An effort must be taken to accomplish these goals or our planet will it would be too late to save Earth. Some of the Sustainable Development Goals are provided in the list below.</strong></p>
          <ol>
               <li>Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
               <li>Affordable and Clean Energy</li>
               <li>Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
               <li>Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
               <li>Climate Action</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>And there are 12 more too! If we tried our best to implement these goals in our daily lives, so much would chnage!<br>
               Very recently an event had taken place in Egypt from 6-20 November 2022 which was named COP27. This event was held so specially for a specific purpose: Climate change. Leaders of a numerous amount of countries gathered in Egypt to discuss about climate change, its impacts and how to get rid of climate change. I am not going tu dwell on this topic for long but I will summarise it: Every leader in that summit promised to help the environment someway or another and they discussed the impacts of clmate change.<br>
               The leaders who attended also stated that they would spread the word to the citizens of their respective country. Many meetings have been held before this one which were quite similar to COP27. Furthermore, In te previous section I had mentioned the different types of pollution and in the list below, I have written the 3 main steps on how to combat pollution. I am sure that you have already heard of these steps and they are also represented in the GIF above.</strong></p>
              
          <ol>
               <li>Reuse</li>
               <li>Reduce</li>
               <li>Recycle</li>
          </ol>

          
          <p><strong>Instead of becoming more dependent, we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and electricity right away. Opt for eco-friendly options like solar energy and wind power.<br>
               Walk and cycle for short distances instead of driving vehicles that produce harmful gases. Roads are clogged with vehicles that use diesel. Even one car gone can make a difference. For longer distances, use public transport or carpool as much as possible.<br>
               Eat more Vegetables. If you eat more vegetarian foods like legumes, beans, nuts, fruits and vegetables; it can significanttly improve you enviromental impact, as Animals require lots of food land and water to be grown to end in your mouths.
