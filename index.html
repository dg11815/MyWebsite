  <h2>Planet Earth</h2>
    
  <p><strong>Earth.<br> Earth, the place where we live is unlike any planet and <em>unique in multiple ways.</em> Earth is the 3rd planet away from the sun with a diameter of over <em>11,750 Km!</em> Our planet Earth hosts living spaces to <em>various types of creatures and and artificial creations alike.</em> <br><br>
    Earth is also very well known to be the <em>only planet confirmed to host life.</em> However, this is a contreversial statement. While Earth provides <em>life, land and water to every being on Earth</em>, most of us don't pay back and fulfill our duty that we owe to our Earth such as <em>keeping our Planet clean, safe and pristine.</em><br><br>
    Despite these problems, I feel that <em>if we all make sure to work as a team, not as a city, not as a country but an entire world,</em> we can easily conquer various difficulties approaching towards Earth's population whether animals or humans at a <em>lightning fast speed.</em> In his webpage, I have listed some problems which we are already suffering and problems that are coming <em>rapidly</em> towards Earth. However, I have also attached ways on how we can <em>stop these difficulties from occuring in the first place</em> and how to make the present problems disappear.<br><br>
    I request you, the reader to read on <em>even more</em> to increase your knowledge on our beloved Earth and try to spread the word on how to <em>stop these issues from arising</em> in the first place.</strong> </p><br><br><br>
